## Data ecosystems
### The various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, stored, organize, analyze, and share data.

## Stages of the data life cycle

### Planning
### Capture
### Manage
### Analyze
### Archive
### Destroy

## Database
### A collection of data stored in a computer system

## You have learned that there are six stages to the data life cycle. Here's a recap:

### Plan: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.

### Capture: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.

### Manage: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.

### Analyze: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.

### Archive: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.

### Destroy: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

## Stakeholders
### People who have invseted time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome

## Tools uses for data analysis
### Spreadsheets
### Quey languages for database
### Visualization Tools

## Issue
### A topic or subject to investigate

## Business Task
### The question or problem data analysis answers for a business

## Fairness
### Ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias

## Data analysts typically work with six problem types
### 1. Making predictions
### 2. Categorizing things
### 3. Spotting something unusual
### 4. Identifying themes
### 5. Discovering connections
### 6. Finding patterns

## SMART questions
### S pecific
### M easurable
### A ction-oriented
### R elevant
### T ime-bound

## Specific: 
## Is the question specific? Does it address the problem? Does it have context? Will it uncover a lot of the information you need?
## Measurable: Will the question give you answers that you can measure?
## Action-oriented: Will the answers provide information that helps you devise some type of plan?
## Relevant: Is the question about the particular problem you are trying to solve?
## Time-bound: Are the answers relevant to the specific time being studied?

## Things to avoid when asking questions

### Leading questions: questions that only have a particular response

### Example: This product is too expensive, isn’t it?

### This is a leading question because it suggests an answer as part of the question. A better question might be, “What is your  ### opinion of this product?” There are tons of answers to that question, and they could include information about usability, 
### features, accessories, color, reliability, and popularity, on top of price. Now, if your problem is actually focused on 
### pricing, you could ask a question like “What price (or price range) would make you consider purchasing this product?” This ### question would provide a lot of different measurable responses.

## Closed-ended questions: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only

### Example: Were you satisfied with the customer trial?

### This is a closed-ended question because it doesn’t encourage people to expand on their answer. It is really easy for them to ### give one-word responses that aren’t very informative. A better question might be, “What did you learn about customer ### experience from the trial.” This encourages people to provide more detail besides “It went well.”

## Vague questions: questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context

### Example: Does the tool work for you?

### This question is too vague because there is no context. Is it about comparing the new tool to the one it replaces? You just ### don’t know. A better inquiry might be, “When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the ### old tool? If faster, how much time is saved? If slower, how much time is lost?” These questions give context (data entry) and ### help frame responses that are measurable (time).

## Algorithm
### A process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task

### The phrase “data-driven decisions” means exactly that: Data is used to arrive at a decision.

### Data-inspired decisions include the same considerations as data-driven decisions while adding another layer of complexity. ### They create space for people using data to consider a broader range of ideas: drawing on comparisons to related concepts, 
### giving weight to feelings and experiences, and considering other qualities that may be more difficult to measure. 

## Qaulitative data
### Subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics 

## There are two types of data: qualitative and quantitative. 
## Qualitative data tools
### - Focus groups
### - Social media text analysis
### - In-person interviews

## Quantitative data tools
### - Structured interviews
### - Surveys
### - Polls

## Metrics
## Revenue = Num of Sales * the sales price
## ROI = Return on investment

## Metric Goal
### A measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics

## The three (or four) V words for big data

## Volume
### The amount of data
## Variety
### The different kinds of data 	
## Velocity
### How fast the data can be processed	
## Veracity
### The quality and reliability of the data

	
## Some common math function
### Sum
### Average
### Count
### Min
### Max

## Formula
### A set of instructions that performs a specific calculation

## Problem Domain
### The specific area of analysis that encompasses every activity affecting or affected by the problem

### Context in data analytics is the condition and circumstances that surround and give meaning to the data. Context is important in data analytics because it helps make disorganized data accessible and understood. The fact is, data has little value if it is not paired with context.
