# Why data visualization matters

# the McCandless method lists four elements of good data visualization: 

    ## Information: the data with which youâ€™re working 

    ## Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept

    ## Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual

    ## Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression
